#Prime Factors of an Integer
The prime factors of an integer are the prime numbers which, when multiplied together, result in
the original integer. 

In the Prime Factors kata, you write a routine that takes one argument – a positive, non-zero
integer – and returns a list of the integer’s prime factors. If the integer has no prime factors, return
an empty list. The data types of the argument and return value depend on the programming
language you are using.

Use classic-style test-driven development with example-based microtests to perform the kata.

Write the examples in the order given below.
